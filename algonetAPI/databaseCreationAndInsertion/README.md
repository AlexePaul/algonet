# Database Creation and Sample Data Insertion

#### Overview
This directory contains SQL scripts that help set up a PostgreSQL database with tables for managing problems, solutions, users, and related data. The scripts include:

1. **`creation.sql`**: This script defines the structure of the database, creating all necessary tables and foreign key relationships.
2. **`insertion.sql`**: This script inserts sample data into the tables, allowing you to quickly populate the database with realistic data to work with.

#### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL must be installed and configured.

#### Notes
1. **`Creation.sql`** has been generated using the website [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io) 
2. **`Insertion.sql`** has been generated using ChatGPT.
